# Team Work Contract

The team work contract outlines the collaboration methods among team members and specifies detailed arrangements and expectations. This document will standardize the working relationship within the team and help resolve potential issues.

## Key Components

### Work Distribution
- Work will be distributed fairly and reasonably based on individual strengths and interests.
- Responsibilities for tasks will rotate to ensure all team members have exposure to various aspects of the project.

### Expected Work Hours
- Team members are expected to dedicate at least 3 hours per week to the project.
- Core working hours are from 2 PM to 5 PM on weekdays to ensure availability for synchronous collaboration.

### Meetings
- Weekly meetings will be held every Friday at 6 PM.
- Meeting agendas will be prepared by a rotating meeting leader and shared 24 hours in advance.
- Meeting minutes will be recorded by a designated note-taker and shared within 24 hours after the meeting.

### Communication
- Team members will use Slack for daily communication and Zoom for virtual meetings.
- All team members are expected to respond to messages within 24 hours during weekdays.

### Working Style
- Each meeting will start with a brief stand-up session where team members report progress and blockers.

### Work Quality
- Each team member is expected to submit high-quality, thoroughly reviewed work.
- Peer reviews will be conducted for critical project components.

### Availability
- Team members should notify the group in advance about unavailable times (e.g., evenings or weekends).

## Updates
The team work contract will be stored in a file named `team-contract.md` in the project root and updated only with the consensus of all team members.
