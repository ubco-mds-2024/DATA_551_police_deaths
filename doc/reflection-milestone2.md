# Reflection - Milestone 2

## Implemented Features
As of this milestone, we have successfully implemented the following features in our dashboard:

### **Filtering & User Controls**
1. **Functional Filter by Cause/State:**
   - Users can filter officer deaths based on different causes and U.S. states.
   - Includes a **"Select/Unselect All"** button for convenience.

2. **Functional Year Range Filter:**
   - Users can drag a **start and end year slider** to define the time range of displayed data.

3. **Officer Type Selection:**
   - Allows filtering by **Police Officers** and **Canine Officers**.

### **Visualizations**
4. **Line Chart - Officer Deaths Over Time:**
   - Displays the **trend of officer deaths** across selected years.
   - Includes **interactive features** such as zooming and tooltips.

5. **Heatmap - U.S. State-Level Officer Deaths:**
   - Visualizes the **geospatial distribution of officer deaths** across U.S. states.
   - Updates dynamically based on filters.

6. **Top 10 Causes of Officer Deaths (Bar Chart):**
   - Highlights the **leading causes of officer fatalities**.

7. **Top 10 Departments with the Most Officer Deaths (Bar Chart):**
   - Shows which **law enforcement departments** have reported the highest number of fatalities.

### **Summary Statistics**
8. **Statistical Summary Boxes:**
   - Displays key statistics:
     - **Total Deaths**
     - **Average Deaths per Year**
     - **Annual Growth Rate (%)**

## Features Not Yet Implemented
Despite the progress made, there are still improvements to be addressed in the next development phase:

### **User Interface & Layout Adjustments**
1. **Layout Adjustments:**
   - The current layout is **too tight**, causing some graphs to be **partially hidden**.
   - Future improvements will include **resizing graphs** for better visibility.

2. **Improving the Officer Type Filter Placement:**
   - Currently, the **Police/Canine filter** is **not easy to locate**.
   - We may **relocate it** to a more prominent position for better accessibility.

### **Graph Readability & Labeling Enhancements**
3. **Polishing Plot Titles & Axis Labels:**
   - Some **titles and axis labels** need refinement for **better readability**.

4. **Adjusting Sidebar Width:**
   - The **left column (filters) is too wide**, reducing space for visualizations.
   - Future adjustments will **reduce the filter panel width** and **increase graph size**.

### **Enhanced Data Exploration Features**
5. **Easier Access to Specific Year Statistics:**
   - Currently, users must **manually drag the year filter** to view specific data.
   - A planned improvement is to add an **input field for users to enter a specific year** for quick queries.

## Reflection on Dashboard Performance
### **Strengths**
- The dashboard provides **a structured and interactive way** to analyze officer death statistics.
- The **filters dynamically update** the visualizations, enhancing usability.
- The **heatmap and time-series visualizations** effectively communicate trends.

### **Limitations**
- **Limited space causes graphs to be cut off.**
- **Some elements are not intuitively placed**, making it harder for users to find relevant filters.
- **No quick method for querying a specific year**, which could improve data accessibility.

## Future Improvements & Additions
1. **Enhance Layout & Spacing:**
   - Resize graphs and optimize placement to **reduce clutter**.
2. **Improve Filter Visibility:**
   - Relocate **officer type filters** for **easier access**.
3. **Interactive Year Selection:**
   - Add a **direct input field** to allow users to **enter a specific year** instead of relying on sliders.
4. **Refine Graph Labels & Legends:**
   - Ensure all charts have **clear titles, axis labels, and tooltips**.
5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Optimize large dataset handling to **improve load times**.
