# Proposal for Police Deaths in US History

## Motivation and Purpose

### Our Role:
A student research group focused on historical trends in public service safety.

### Target Audience:
Researchers, policymakers, and educators in public safety and law enforcement.

Police deaths in the U.S. from 1791 to 2016 reflect historical challenges in public safety and law enforcement. Understanding trends in causes of deaths, geographic distribution, and agency-level patterns can inform policies to improve officer safety.

To address this need, we propose building a **data visualization dashboard**. Our goal is to empower researchers, policymakers, and educators to explore the dataset interactively. Users will be able to identify trends, evaluate the impact of various causes of death over time, and understand the distribution of incidents across the U.S. This dashboard will serve as a resource for decision-making, public education, and improving workplace safety in law enforcement.

## Description of the Data

Our dataset consists of approximately **22,800 records** documenting police deaths in U.S. history from **1791 to 2016**, sourced from the **Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP)**, a database started in 1996 by a college student who later became a police officer. This dataset is publicly available on the **FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository** and was used in their story *“The Dallas Shooting Was Among The Deadliest For Police In U.S. History.”*

The dataset includes detailed information about individual officers, their departments, and the circumstances surrounding their deaths. Specifically, it captures variables such as:

- **Officer Information**: Names, departments, and ranks.
- **Incident Details**: "End of Watch" (EOW) dates, causes of death (both detailed and categorized), states, and years.
- **K9 Cases**: Flags for canine unit fatalities, enabling analysis of deaths involving both human officers and police dogs.

## Research Questions and Usage Scenarios

The dashboard will address a series of research questions aimed at uncovering patterns, trends, and key insights related to police fatalities across the United States. By utilizing the dataset’s comprehensive variables, the dashboard will provide actionable insights for improving officer safety.

### Proposed Research Questions:
1. **Primary Causes of Death**: What are the leading causes of police fatalities, and how have they evolved over time?
2. **Geographic Trends**: How do police fatality trends vary across different states, regions, or departments?
3. **Temporal Fluctuations**: How have annual police fatality rates fluctuated over the years, and what factors might contribute to these changes?
4. **Incident-Specific Patterns**: Are there discernible patterns based on specific incident types (e.g., automobile accidents, gunfire) or temporal factors (e.g., seasonality, time of day)?
5. **Demographic Trends**: What demographic patterns exist among fallen officers, such as variations in age, rank, and years of service?

These questions balance **exploratory analysis** with **practical application**, offering insights into historical patterns while guiding modern safety strategies. For example, understanding shifts in fatality causes can inform safety protocols, while regional trends might address disparities in officer risks.

### Usage Scenario:

**Detective Lisa** is a crime analyst working for a U.S. police department. Her team is responsible for assessing officer safety risks and proposing policy changes to improve training and operational protocols.

Using the dashboard, Lisa:
1. Explores a **heatmap** of police (including K9 officers) fatalities across different states and notices higher fatality rates in specific regions.
2. Examines a **bar chart** highlighting the top 10 causes of death and filters the data to focus on automobile- and gunfire-related deaths.
3. Analyzes a **time-series graph** to discover that while gunfire-related deaths have declined, automobile-related fatalities have increased in recent years.
4. Applies a **year-by-year filter** to identify peak years and examines potential causes for fatality spikes.

With these insights, Lisa compiles a report recommending:
- Enhanced defensive driving training for officers.
- Improved safety measures for K9 transport.
- Additional protocols for high-risk assignments.

The dashboard's interactive design and dynamic filters allow Lisa and her team to uncover patterns and trends efficiently, guiding **data-driven decisions** for enhanced officer safety.

This proposal aims to bridge the gap between historical analysis and actionable policy recommendations by providing a versatile and user-friendly tool for exploring police death data across U.S. history.
